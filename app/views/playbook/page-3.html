      <p>The Catalogue Agreement is an evergreen contract (it has no expiry) between the Catalogue Authority (NHS Digital) and a Catalogue Solution Supplier. 
        There is only one version of the Catalogue Agreement, updated via a Common Change Control process, no bespoke versions of it are accepted.</p>

       <p>The Catalogue Agreement provides for the submission of Catalogue Solutions through an OnBoarding process, which includes functional assessment 
        (Capability mapping and Capability Assessment), assurance against relevant Standards and the creation of a Catalogue Solution Listing (comprehensive solution 
        data set inc. List Price information). At the end of this process the Catalogue Solution has achieved Compliant Status.</p>  
        
       <p>Compliant Status is required for participation in contracts, and the Standards applied therefore become the baseline specification for health and social care 
        systems within the domain.</p>
        
      <p>Within the Catalogue Agreement, a Roadmap is published which describes the application of new Standards and lifecycle development of existing ones. 
        Suppliers are obliged to continue to meet the criteria for compliance, including where new Standards are introduced for their Catalogue Solutions via 
        the Roadmap.</p>

      <p>The Catalogue Agreement encompasses everything necessary to enable the Roadmap to operate effectively, including constraints/rules regarding the Roadmap, 
      community governance, dispute resolution, contract governance. It is an extensive contract but is generally considered by suppliers to be very reasonable 
      (it is deliberately even handed in order to secure consent to impose the Roadmap).</p>

      <P>In the universe of the Catalogue Agreement, anything is a Standard by dint of being named as such within the Roadmap and the reverse is true, that nothing 
        can be considered to be a Standard under the Catalogue Agreement unless it has been published as such through the Roadmap. However we have adopted a pattern 
        which aligns to Standards & Standards bodies in the wider system.  Specifically this comprises: </P>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a set of over arching product Standards which align to (but exceed)  the Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC).</li>
          <li>Data and Information Standards. These are generally derived from an ISN, and include things like SNOMED for Primary Care or the About Me Standard for Adult Social Care.</li>
          <li>Interoperability Standards. These are either national service integrations (e.g. PDS, ERS, EPS, Pathology messaging) or specifications for general interop services (e.g. IM1, GP Connect). 
              These utilise a range of published NHS Digital Standards as well some ISNss</li>
          <li>Market specific Standards for example the Commercial Standard or Data Migration Standard which are vital control mechanisms designed to offset difficulties in the current environment.
            These are created wholly from within the Catalogue.</li>
        </ul>

        <P>Where a supplier falls into Non-compliance then a series of remedial actions are triggered which are designed to bring them back into Compliance, however if the breach is serious enough or is not 
          remedied appropriately then the Catalogue Authority terminates the Catalogue Agreement with that Supplier and all of their associated procurement contracts related to that Catalogue 
          Solution are invalidated as a result.</P>
